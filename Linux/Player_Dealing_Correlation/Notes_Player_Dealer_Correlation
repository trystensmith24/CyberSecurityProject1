In total, the casino has had major losses a total of 13 times over the course of three
days. The times in which these losses have occurred have always been consistent; taking
place during one of five times throughout a 24-hour period. During these times where
losses have occurred, one dealer has always been dealing, Billy Jones, and one player,
Mylie Schmidt, have both been present EVERY single table that has had major losses.
I believe it is too much of a coincidence, and that these two are colluding to steal
money and scam the Lucky Duck Casino.
